## ⚙️ Preparation Before the Workshop

Participants are expected to bring their own laptops and, if possible, set up CHAPSim2 in advance.

### 1. Clone CHAPSim2

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CCP-NTH/CHAPSim2.git
cd CHAPSim2
```

### 2. Attempt to compile CHAPSim2

This is recommended but not mandatory. We will help troubleshoot installation issues during the workshop, for example at lunch time.

```bash
./build_chapsim.sh
```

You may need a Fortran compiler and MPI installed, such as `gfortran`, OpenMPI, or MPICH.

### 3. Familiarise yourself with basic tools

Please try to familiarise yourself with:

- Basic bash/terminal usage
- Basic plotting tools, such as:
  - Python
  - ParaView

### Note

Reference datasets and post-processing examples will be provided during the workshop.  
There is no need to download large datasets in advance.

## 💻 What to Bring

Please bring:

- A laptop with terminal access, such as bash or equivalent
- Python installed, if possible
- Basic plotting or visualisation tools, such as Python, and ParaView
- MPI and compiler setup, if available
- CHAPSim2 installed, if possible
- Optional: your own test cases or research problems for discussion
